          <h2>A Land of 2,000 Castles</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content fade-in">
          <p>Czechia holds one of the highest concentrations of castles and chateaux anywhere in Europe. More than 2,000 of them are scattered across the rolling hills of Bohemia and Moravia — perched on limestone bluffs, hidden in deep forests, reflected in still ponds, and presiding over quiet village squares. For a country roughly the size of South Carolina, the density is staggering.</p>

          <p>The story of Czech castles stretches across nearly a millennium of European history. The earliest stone fortifications date to the 13th century, when Bohemian kings and local nobility raised Gothic strongholds on strategic hilltops to control trade routes and defend borders. As centuries passed, tastes evolved: Renaissance elegance transformed medieval keeps into grand residences with arcaded courtyards and sgraffito facades. The Baroque era brought sweeping palace complexes with formal gardens, chapels, and theatres. By the 19th century, Romantic revivalism saw wealthy families rebuild ancient ruins into fairytale fantasies.</p>

          <p>What makes the Czech castle landscape truly special is its variety. Within a single day's drive, you can stand in the shadow of a brooding Gothic fortress, wander the sun-drenched courtyard of a Renaissance chateau, explore a lavish Baroque palace, and climb through the atmospheric remnants of a hilltop ruin. No two are alike, and each tells a different chapter of the country's layered history.</p>

          <p>Unlike many countries where castle visits feel like museum tours behind velvet ropes, Czech castles are often embedded in living landscapes — surrounded by hiking trails, vineyards, breweries, and villages. A castle visit here is rarely just a castle visit. It's a day trip through the countryside, a walk through forests, a lunch in a village pub, and a slow return as the light fades over the hills.</p>

          <h2>Castle Types &amp; What to Expect</h2>
          <p>Czech castles come in distinct flavors. Understanding the types helps you choose the right ones for your trip — and mix them for the best experience.</p>

            <h3 class="feature-card__title">Fairytale Chateaux</h3>
            <p class="feature-card__desc">White turrets, manicured gardens, ornate interiors. These are the postcard castles — Renaissance and Neo-Gothic residences built to impress. Think Hluboka, Lednice, and Bouzov. Perfect for families, photographers, and anyone who grew up on fairy tales. Guided interior tours showcase period furniture, art collections, and aristocratic life across the centuries.</p>

            <h3 class="feature-card__title">Gothic Fortresses</h3>
            <p class="feature-card__desc">Stone walls, massive towers, strategic hilltop positions. These castles were built for defense — to guard trade routes, protect borders, and project power. Karlstejn, Krivoklat, and Kost are prime examples. Expect dramatic approaches, thick walls with arrow slits, and interiors that feel like stepping into medieval history. Many host historical reenactments and night tours.</p>

            <h3 class="feature-card__title">Baroque Palaces</h3>
            <p class="feature-card__desc">Grand estates with sweeping formal gardens, ornamental lakes, and interiors dripping with frescoes and gilding. Czech Baroque palaces like Valtice, Kuks, and Jaroměřice were designed as cultural showcases — many had their own theatres, music halls, and extensive libraries. The surrounding parklands are destinations in themselves, ideal for long walks and picnics.</p>

            <h3 class="feature-card__title">Romantic Ruins</h3>
            <p class="feature-card__desc">Crumbling walls, open sky, wildflowers growing between the stones. Czech castle ruins are among the most atmospheric places in the country. Trosky, Rabi, Bezděz, and dozens of lesser-known ruins reward hikers with solitude, panoramic views, and a powerful sense of time passing. Many sit within nature reserves, making them perfect anchors for a half-day hike through the countryside.</p>

          <span class="section__label">Practical Tips</span>
          <h2>Planning Your Castle Visit</h2>
          <p>A few things worth knowing before you head out. Czech castles have their own rhythms, and a little planning goes a long way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content fade-in">
          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>Most castles open from April through October, with full schedules in the peak summer months of June through August. May and September are the sweet spot — pleasant weather, fewer crowds, and golden light for photography. Some major castles like Karlstejn and Cesky Krumlov offer limited winter tours, and the experience of a snow-dusted castle with no crowds is genuinely magical. Autumn is particularly spectacular: the forests surrounding most castles turn brilliant shades of red and gold, creating natural frames for the architecture above.</p>

          <h3>Opening Hours &amp; Tours</h3>
          <p>Czech castles typically operate on guided tour schedules, not free-roaming access. Tours run at fixed times (often on the hour), last 45-60 minutes, and are available in Czech with English-language text sheets or audio guides. Some larger castles offer dedicated English-language tours at specific times — check ahead and arrive early. Last tours usually depart one hour before closing. Many castles offer multiple tour routes covering different parts of the complex, so you can spend a full morning exploring a single site.</p>

          <h3>Getting There</h3>
          <p>Czechia's excellent public transport network reaches most major castles. Trains and regional buses connect Prague with Karlstejn (40 min), Kutna Hora (1 hr), Konopiste (1 hr), and Cesky Krumlov (2.5 hrs by bus). For more remote castles like Bouzov or Trosky, a combination of train and local bus works, though a car gives you more flexibility to combine multiple castles in one day. RegioJet and Czech Railways (CD) both offer comfortable, affordable connections.</p>

          <h3>Photography Tips</h3>
          <p>Castle exteriors are free to photograph anytime. Interior photography varies — some castles allow it (sometimes with a small fee for a photo permit), while others restrict it during guided tours. The best exterior photos come in early morning or late afternoon when the light is warm and the crowds are thin. For iconic shots, scout viewpoints from nearby hills or across rivers. Drone regulations apply near historic monuments, so check local rules before flying.</p>

          <h3>Combining Castles with Other Experiences</h3>
          <p>The best castle days in Czechia combine architecture with landscape. Walk from the train station through a village to reach the castle. Have lunch at a local hospoda (pub) nearby. Continue on a marked trail through the forest to the next village or viewpoint. Many castles sit near wine regions, breweries, or nature reserves — building a full day around a castle visit is far more rewarding than treating it as a check-box stop.</p>
