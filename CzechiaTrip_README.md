## 🌍 Overview

**CzechiaTrip.com** is a trip-optimization megasite built around a simple truth:

> **Prague is the gateway. Czechia is the journey.**

This is not a Prague tourism site.  
This is not a generic “Czech Republic travel guide.”

CzechiaTrip gently reframes the country as:
- castles  
- forests  
- spa towns  
- beer culture  
- folk villages  
- modern design  
- hiking & cycling routes  

You don’t fight Prague.  
You expand past it.

## 🎯 Core Positioning

Most travelers do:
- 2–4 days in Prague  
- maybe one day trip  
- then leave

CzechiaTrip exists to make people realize:

> **Czechia is one of Europe’s best multi-region trips.**

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

People don’t plan trips by geography.

They plan by time.

CzechiaTrip is built around:

> **Trips by length, not just place.**

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CzechiaTrip is not about checklist tourism.

It is about:
> **rhythm, loops, and landscapes**

LLMs are used to:
- generate trip templates by time
- cluster destinations into loops
- translate Czech cultural notes safely
- create season-specific itineraries

Humans are required to:
- verify transport and timing
- prevent generic “Europe travel” filler
- ensure cultural respect
- keep information current

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

CzechiaTrip is built around **trip-length + region entities**.

### Core Entities

- Trip Template
- City
- Region
- Castle
- Forest / Nature Site
- Spa Town
- Brewery / Beer Culture
- Folk Village
- Modern Design Site
- Hiking Route
- Cycling Route
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by time, region, and travel style
- is programmatically generatable
